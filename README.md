- Project Update: HMU is Officially Discontinued.
 The HMU project has officially reached its end. The last major update focused on essential bug fixes to ensure stability for existing users.

 While I wonâ€™t be continuing active development myself, the project will remain open for community contributions. Future updates, if any, will be driven entirely by the community.

 Moving forward, Iâ€™ll be focusing my energy on new projects, with a strong emphasis on CSS and front-end experimentation.

 Thanks to everyone who supported HMU along the way!
